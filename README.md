# finalCapstone

A Python function that when passed a 2-dimensional list of: 

| Symbol | Representation |
| --- | --- |
| `-` | mine-free spot |
| `#` | mine-laden spot |

Will return the same list but each `-` replaced with an integer to represent the number of adjacent mines, akin to the game minesweeper.

Such a function could potentially be used in creating a version of the game minesweeper exclusively in python.
 
## Installation

Only in-built methods and no external packages are used so base python is sufficient. 

## Usage
- Must be passed a 2-dimensional list
- Passed 2-dimensional list need not be square but each sub-list must be of equal length

Example input and output:
